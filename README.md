# Optimizing Guest Experience by Enhancing Customer Satisfaction at OverU Hotel

This project addresses a critical guest experience issue at OverU Hotel: the low satisfaction rating of the check-in/check-out process. By improving the Net Promoter Score (NPS) in this area, OverU aims to not only increase customer satisfaction but also drive long-term loyalty, boosting overall hotel performance and reputation.

## Project Background

OverU Hotel, a global hospitality company, values customer satisfaction as a core driver of business success. However, recent NPS surveys revealed that while guests rate amenities highly (4.2/5), the check-in and check-out experience lags significantly at 2.2/5. This project aims to identify actionable insights for transforming this essential part of the guest journey.

## Key Goals

The primary goal is to elevate the check-in/check-out NPS from 2.2 to 4.0 within 12 months. To achieve this, we focus on understanding guest pain points and streamlining the process, creating a smoother and more welcoming experience from arrival to departure.

## Root Cause Analysis and Solutions

Through a detailed analysis, several factors emerged as primary drivers behind the low NPS score, including long wait times, complex processes, and inconsistent service standards. Addressing these root causes can lead to meaningful improvements:
- **Reducing Wait Times**: By optimizing staffing and queue management, we aim to cut waiting times by 20-30%, directly enhancing guest satisfaction.
- **Streamlining Processes**: Simplifying check-in/check-out steps by 10-15% will reduce friction for guests, helping them feel more at ease.
- **Improving Staff Training**: Enhancing staff skills and service consistency will create a friendlier and more efficient experience.

## Key Metrics for Success

To track progress and effectiveness, we will monitor these metrics:
- **Average Resolution Time (ART)**: Shorter resolution times indicate smoother, more efficient processes.
- **Average Wait Time (AWT)**: Reduced wait times reflect improved queue and staffing efficiency.
- **Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT)**: Measures guest satisfaction improvements, validating the impact of targeted staff training and service quality enhancements.

## Why This Matters

An exceptional check-in and check-out experience sets the tone for a guest's stay, and improving this can lead to higher satisfaction and loyalty. This project not only provides OverU Hotel with a strategy to enhance NPS but also reinforces its commitment to hospitality excellence, creating lasting positive impressions for guests worldwide.
